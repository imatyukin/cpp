// 7. Write a grammar for bitwise logical expressions. A bitwise logical expression is much like an arithmetic expression except that the operators are ! (not), ~ (complement), & (and), | (or), and ^ (exclusive or). Each operator does its operation to each bit of its integer operands (see ยง25.5). ! and ~ are prefix unary operators. A ^ binds tighter than a | (just as * binds tighter than +) so that x|y^z means x|(y^z) rather than (x|y)^z. The & operator binds tighter than ^ so that x^y&z means x^(y&z).

**Grammar**

    Expression:
        PTerm
        Expression "|" PTerm
    PTerm:
        STerm
        PTerm "^" STerm
    STerm:
        Unary
        STerm "&" Unary
    Unary:
        Primary
        "!" Primary
        "~" Primary
    Primary:
        Number
        "(" Expression ")"
    Number:
        integer-number
