// 9. Write a program that reads digits and composes them into integers. For example, 123 is read as the characters 1,
// 2, and 3. The program should output 123 is 1 hundred and 2 tens and 3 ones. The number should be output as an int
// value. Handle numbers with one, two, three, or four digits. Hint: To get the integer value 5 from the character '5'
// subtract '0', that is, '5'â€“'0'==5.
