// 14. Design and implement a Money class for calculations involving dollars and cents where arithmetic has to be
// accurate to the last cent using the 4/5 rounding rule (.5 of a cent rounds up; anything less than .5 rounds down).
// Represent a monetary amount as a number of cents in a long int, but input and output as dollars and cents, e.g.,
// $123.45. Do not worry about amounts that donâ€™t fit into a long int.
