// Exercise 2-4.
// For your birthday youâ€™ve been given a long tape measure and an instrument that measures angles (the angle between the
// horizontal and a line to the top of a tree, for instance). If you know the distance, d, you are from a tree, and the
// height, h, of your eye when peering into your angle-measuring device, you can calculate the height of the tree with
// the formula h + d*tan(angle). Create a program to read h in inches, d in feet and inches, and angle in degrees from
// the keyboard, and output the height of the tree in feet.
