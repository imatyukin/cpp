// Exercise 5-8.
// The famous Fibonacci series is a sequence of integers with the first two values as 1 and the subsequent values as the
// sum of the two preceding values. So, it begins 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. This is not just a mathematical
// curiosity. The sequence also regularly appears in biological settings, for instance. It relates to the way shells
// grow in a spiral, and the number of petals on many flowers is a number from this sequence. Create an array<>
// container with 93 elements. Store the first 93 numbers in the Fibonacci series in the array and then output them one
// per line. Any idea why weâ€™d be asking you to generate 93 Fibonacci numbers and not, say, 100?
